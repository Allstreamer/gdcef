# Chromium Embedded Framework as Godot 3.4+ native module

This repository contains the source code of some C++ classes wrapping a subset
of the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Home)
API into a Godot 3.4+ native module (GDNative) which allows you to
implement a web browser for your 2D and 3D games through your gdscripts for
Linux and for Windows. We have named this CEF GDNative module `gdcef`.

This module can downloaded directly from the Godot asset library:

https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1426
